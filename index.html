                    Outside of coding, I find joy in various activities such as going on
                    invigorating runs, hitting the gym, immersing
                    myself in PC games, and exploring new culinary delights through cooking experiments. I

                            Contributed in the development of HelpYa's backend, a trade service app, by crafting a
                            resilient RESTful API
                            using Node.js. This enabled crucial features like secure login, user management, and smooth
                            monetary transactions.
                            To ensure everything worked seamlessly, I conducted thorough testing, from checking
                            individual functionalities with
                            endpoint tests to simulating real-world scenarios with integration tests. And not to forget,
                            I also took charge of
                            creating a sturdy database to keep everything running smoothly. In addition to designing and
                            implementing a robust
                            database to securely store data, I meticulously conducted unit testing to verify its

                        <p>
                            Developed a psychiatrist chatbot centered on addressing loneliness,
                            engaging users in conversations akin to those with a psychiatrist, primarily focusing on
                            discussing and understanding loneliness through written text interactions. The chatbot
                            initiates with greeting exchanges and prompts users to share their feelings or concerns,
                            concentrating specifically on the topic of loneliness. This involves creating a database
                            containing pre-defined sentences as prompts, each associated with corresponding responses,
                            covering
                            various aspects of loneliness and related concerns. A software system was developed to
                            compare the
                            similarity of user input sentences with prompts in the database, identifying the prompt most
                            closely
                            resembling the user's input, enabling the chatbot to select an appropriate response.
                            Implemented in Python, the chatbot integrates APIs and employs a graphical user interface
                            (GUI) for ease of interaction, with its functionality tailored specifically to address
                            loneliness, ensuring that user interactions revolve around this theme. The chatbot was aimed
                            to
                            provide users with support and companionship during times of isolation, such as the
                            pandemic.
